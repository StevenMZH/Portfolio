const e={name:"Steven Mendoza",title:["Fullstack Developer & ","Backend Systems Designer"],image:"profile_pic.webp",description:`I design and build **Backend systems** end-to-end, focusing on APIs, authentication, and infrastructure.
I work on creating Cloud-ready services with an emphasis on **System design**, scalability, and long-term maintainability.`,aboutMe:["I approach backend development from a **Systems perspective**, focusing on how components interact and evolve over time. I value thoughtful technical decisions and maintainable architectures over short-term or overly complex solutions.","I enjoy working close to the **Core of a system**: Designing APIs, Defining responsibilities, Modeling data, and Reasoning about tradeoffs related to scalability and reliability. I’m especially motivated by projects that require understanding system behavior rather than implementing isolated features.","My interest in backend systems is strongly influenced by my background in computer networks, digital electronics, and applied mathematics, which shapes how I reason about data flow and architectural decisions.","I am currently in my final year of Cybernetic Electronics Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in **Systems thinking** and Engineering **Problem-solving**. I value collaboration and clear communication, and I enjoy working in team environments where ideas are shared and refined collectively."],footer:"2026 Steven Mendoza"},n=[{name:"LinkedIn",url:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-mendoza-z/",img:"linkedin.svg"},{name:"GitHub",url:"https://github.com/steven-mendoza-z",img:"github.svg"},{name:"Instagram",url:"https://www.instagram.com/steven.mendoza.z/",img:"instagram.svg"}];export{n as a,e as s};
